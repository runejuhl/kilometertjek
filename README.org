* kilometertjek
Look up license plates from a given car model identifier using
https://nummerpladeregister.dk/ and use the plates to look up detailed
information from https://www.tjekbil.dk/.

This can be used to e.g. get an idea of the average odometer count for a given
car model to try to assess how durable the model is.
